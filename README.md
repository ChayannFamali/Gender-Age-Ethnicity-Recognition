# Gender-Age-Ethnicity-Recognition
This analytical project has three objectives: 1) Gender recognition based on a person's photo; 2) Recognition of ethnicity by photo; 3) Age recognition based on a person's photo
The models cope with these tasks at a good level. The problem of age recognition was considered from two points of view: from the point of view of regression and from the point of view of classification (in this case, the age was divided into ranges)
